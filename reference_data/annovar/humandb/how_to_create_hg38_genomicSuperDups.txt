how hg38_genomicSuperDups.txt was created

Previously used to download from University of Washington:
wget http://humanparalogy.gs.washington.edu/build38/data/GRCh37GenomicSuperDup.tab
However - this does not seem to be maintained any more (e.g. # of fields does not match what annovar expects - while UCSC does)

Download from UCSC

### NOTE ###
Assume that we don't have to worry about whether the data is 0-based or 1-based, as we have downloaded it from UCSC & annovar has specific code that recognises this database.

THE FILENAME MUST BE: hg38_genomicSuperDups.txt - as the annovar code looks for the exact string "genomicSuperDups"

TODO: remove the header - as annovar does not expect headers in region files

PROBLEM: # cols matches but pos columns are 2,3,4 & col 1 is bin
TODO: look at latest version of annovar

superdups leaves embedded "characters"  - equals \x3d and semi-colon \x3b

genomicSuperDups=Score\x3d0.995656\x3bName\x3dchr5:180746946

could get away with just removing these (which is what I think should happen in a post processing step)
