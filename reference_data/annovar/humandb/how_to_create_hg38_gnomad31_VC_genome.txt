hg38_gnomad31_VC_genome.txt

NOTE - similar process to create hg38_gnomad211_VC_exome.txt 

The "_VC" in the filename indicates this has been created by us at Victor Chang
as opposed to being downloaded from the annovar website.  Decide not to put the
"_VC_" on the end, as this makes it harder to interpret the original gnomad
field names.

Background information
----------------------
We previously used hg38_gnomad30_genome.txt, which was downloaded from the annovar
website.  gnomAD released 3.1, so we needed to create this db ourselves (not sure
when annovar would prepare their db).  Also, the annovar db was missing some fields
we wanted (nhomalt & some popmax values).  The annovar db included many ethnicity fields
that we did not regularly use.  After discussion with the variant hunters, we decided to 
use the following fields in the db:

#Chr	Start	End	Ref	Alt	gnomad31_VC_genome_AC	gnomad31_VC_genome_AF	gnomad31_VC_genome_popmax	gnomad31_VC_genome_nhomalt	gnomad31_VC_genome_AF_popmax

Big picture of how the database was created
1. download the VCF files from gnomad (verify checksums)
2. reduce the VCF to the fields we want
3. run vt softare - decompose
4. run vt software - decompose_blocksub
5. run vt software - normalize
6. combine chromosome data into one database file & run convert2annovar_ed.pl
7. index annovar file
